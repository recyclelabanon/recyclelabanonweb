      <p>TerraPods is a hub for creative ecology, integrating agroecology, bio-design, and the arts in a biodiverse space featuring farmland, food forests, medicinal and dye gardens. The facility includes a bio-design makerspace, residency units, a lab kitchen, an art gallery, and an EcoSouk marketplace. Welcoming artists and researchers, TerraPods fosters STEAM-led interdisciplinary collaboration to address environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>The residency program provides creators with a supportive platform to tackle our planetary crises. Engaging with the surroundings, artists contribute to ecological solutions challenging traditional industry and agriculture models, aligning with TerraPods' holistic mission.</p>
      <p>With four residency units, TerraPods focuses on fostering creativity, collaboration, and cross-sectoral engagement. Through the "Grow, Create, Market" initiative, the project promotes self-sufficiency by utilising farm-grown materials for bio-compostable products. The farm serves as a hub for bio-design exploration, developing alternatives to single-use plastics. TerraPods connects creators with consumers through the EcoSouk marketplace, supporting local economies and promoting sustainable consumption. The "grow-create-market" model is central to the project's mission, aiming to increase the availability of locally produced bio-material alternatives and foster a harmonious relationship between the environment and the community.</p>

      <p>A policy and empowerment programme with zero waste clean ups, balaplastic (plastic free) transitions, food waste events and native planting initiatives.</p>
      <p>We pioneered zero-waste sorting & recycling clean-ups at the peak of the waste crisis. Our most memorable moment, the #BalaPlastic installation with Mashrou3Leila concert!</p>
      <p>BalaPlastic concert for Mashrou3Leila, last concert in Lebanon: The plastic invading Mashroue Leila concert is part of the #BalaPlastic movement to raise awareness on the tragic impacts of single use plastic on Lebanon public health, environment and economy. The plastic used at Mashroue Leila concert at the Ehdeniyat festival, was collected from a beach cleanup organised by Greenpeace Mediterranean and Recycle Lebanon, and donated by different NGOs. A group of architects from the American University of Beirut- (DI-LAB) worked on the design of the art installation.</p>
      <p>Art Exhibits: Between 2016 and 2018 we hosted 3 art exhibits during Beirut Design Week with 45 curated artists and trainers exhibited at our 1920's restored heritage residency in Gemayze, including highlighted artists Tom Young, Charbel Samuel Aoun, Noor Haydar, Thierry Magniez, and the Haven for Artist collective calling for a collective Dive Into Action to address the climate crisis in the ecological collapse as a means for hope through action.</p>
